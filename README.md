This project proposes a drone  system equipped with YOLO-based real time object detection algorithms to  accurately identify humans in disaster affected areas, even with low-resolution  cameras. The drone incorporates a GPS  module for precise geolocation and a  wireless communication system for swift  data transmission to ground control.
